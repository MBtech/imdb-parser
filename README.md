## Parser for IMDB
Here's a parser that I am working on just for fun. This is a WIP

Current scripts:
topmovies.py: To get the top 250 movies along with their release date and ratings
ratings.py: To get the rating distribution of a movie

**Note: Use responsibly. If you are sending repeated requests. Don't send more than 1 request/s.**
