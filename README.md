## Parser for IMDB
Here's a parser that I am working on just for fun. This is a WIP

### Available functionality:
- Get listing for movies released within a time period.
- Get list of top movies
- Get list of ratings for any specified title

### Examples:
Currently example include a measure of polarization.
I am going to measure polarization as the difference between total percentage of votes for sum of percentage for 10, 9 and 8 stars versus 1, 2 and 3 stars.
Additional condition is that the combined percentage of these top rating and low rating is more than medium votes.
