## Parser for IMDB
Here's a parser that I am working on just for fun. This is a WIP

### Current scripts:
For now most scripts will be printing out the results. Soon I will transform them into json and then have a database schema for them
#### topmovies.py:
To get the top 250 movies along with their release date and ratings

#### ratings.py:
To get the rating distribution of a movie
